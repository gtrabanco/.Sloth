## About this
[.Sloth](https://github.com/gtrabanco/sloth) is a [Dotly fork](https://github.com/CodelyTV/dotly) which widely changes from original project.

Dotly is a [@rgomezcasas](https://github.com/rgomezcasas) idea supported by [CodelyTV](https://pro.codely.tv)) with the help of a lot of people (see [Dotly Contributors](https://github.com/CodelyTV/dotly/graphs/contributors)).

## Features & differences with Dotly Framework

* Abstraction from Framework loader you only need to add in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` (it will be done automatically but make a backup first).
 ```bash
 DOTFILES_PATH="${HOME}/.dotfiles"
 SLOTH_PATH="${DOTFILES_PATH}/modules/sloth"
. "${SLOTH_PATH:-$DOTLY_PATH}/shell/init-sloth.sh"
 ```
* Init scripts (see (init-scripts)[https://github.com/gtrabanco/dotfiles/tree/master/shell/init.scripts] in (gtrabanco/dotfiles)[https://github.com/gtrabanco/dotfiles]). This provides many possibilities as modular loading of custom variables or aliases by machine, loading secrets... Whatever you can imagine.
* Per machine (or whatever name you want to) export packages `sloth packages dump` (you can use `dot` instead of `sloth`, we also have aliases for this command like `lazy` and `s`).
* Non opinionated `git` scripts.
* Compatibility with all Dotly features and scripts.
* When you install SLOTH a backup of all files that well be linked is done (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.zshenv`... All files in symlinks/conf.yaml and equivalent files that are applied with `sloth core install`). So you won't loose any old data if you migrate to SLOTH.
* Easy way to create new scripts from Terminal `sloth script create --help`
* Easy way to install scripts from Terminal `sloth script install_remote --help`
* Use libraries without download
```bash
url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gtrabanco/sloth/master/scripts/core/src/output.sh"
. <(dot script load_remote "$url") &&
output::write "Using latest output.sh library of .Sloth"
```
* Execute scripts without download (as installer do)
```bash
url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gtrabanco/dotfiles/master/restoration_scripts/98-keybase-import-private-key.sh"
bash <(dot script load_remote "$url")
```
* Scripts marketplace (Coming soon...)
* We promise to reply all issues and support messages and review PRs.
